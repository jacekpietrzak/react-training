    <h2>Stylizacja</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>How to style React components?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JSX code looks very similar to standard HTML. We coud think that we
            could use standard inline styling like this:
            <code>&lt;h1 style="color:red"&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.
            Unfortunately if we do that we will receive few warnings in the
            development tools which means that this is not the right way to do
            that.
          </li>
          <li>
            JSX is not an HTML. There are similarities in both but it wont work
            like that. Instead we can do that:
            <code>&lt;h1 style={{color:"red"}}&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.
            Because we are writing it in JSX the value for prop which here is
            "style" needs to be an object. In JSX, if we want to provide
            something else than a string (number, boolean, variable) we need to
            give it as an object. Value for css is an JS object
            <code>{key: "string value"}</code> . That is why we have object in
            object.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we would like to give a second value we need to use a comma, not
            a semicolon like this:
            <code
              >&lt;h1 style={{color:"red", fontWeight:200
              }}&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code
            >. Because we are in an object. As you see the "fontWeight" is a bit
            different than the css "font-weight" property. If we have few words
            keys we need to do that different Because this would be treated as
            an expression. We need to write it in camelCase.
          </li>
          <li>
            Becaues it is normal JS object, we can make it as a variable.
            <pre>
            <code>const h1Styles = {
              color:"red", 
              fontWeight:200}</code> </pre>
            and use it in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
            tag like this:
            <code>&lt;h1 style={h1Styles}&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
